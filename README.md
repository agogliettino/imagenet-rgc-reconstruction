`src` directory contains the main library of functions, including data set i/o, 
preprocessing and the models. `scripts` directory contains a bunch of 
preprocessing scripts and two others: `train_model.py`, which trains
the model, and the jupyter notebook `model_analysis.ipynb` is where we did
quantitative analysis on the models, and made figures.
